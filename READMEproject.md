# Hang In There

## Description
This is a webpage that randomly generates motivational posters for days when the brain fog comes rolling in a little too thick. When you open the page, some random motivation is automatically generated for you. If the first poster doesn't speak to you, press the "Show Another Random Poster" button to generate some further motivation. You can generate your own poster with your own motivators by clicking the "Make your own poster" button on the far right side. If you change your mind, head on back by pressing the "Nevermind, take me back!" button. To view your saved posters, click "Show saved posters", and it will take you to your own little hype dungeon. When you want to continue making some new posters, click "Back to Main."
