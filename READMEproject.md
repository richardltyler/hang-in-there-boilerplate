# Hang In There

## Description
This is a webpage that randomly generates motivational posters for days when the brain fog comes rolling in a little too thick. When you open the page, some random motivation is automatically generated for you. If the first poster doesn't speak to you, press the "Show Another Random Poster" button to generate some further motivation.

## Set-up
To access this webpage simply click this handy-dandy [link](file:///Users/richardtyler/turing/mod1/projects/hang-in-there-boilerplate/index.html) and you'll be well on your way to brighter skies.

## Project Members
This project was done through the Turing School of Software & Design. Functionality designed by Richard Tyler and Kristen Bair.
